Working with Coverage
#####################

After importing your coverage data, the typical analysis workflow is:

1. **Merge** — combine coverage from all test runs into one database
2. **Explore** — interactively browse the data with the terminal UI
3. **Analyze** — extract summaries, gaps, and hotspots from the CLI
4. **Compare** — detect regressions against a previous run
